            ## PR Size & Scope (PRIORITY CHECK)
            First, evaluate if this PR follows trunk-based development guidelines:
            - Is it focused on a single concern? (If doing multiple things, suggest splitting)
            - Would it be better as a stacked PR using Graphite?
            - If >400 lines changed or >10 files, suggest how to decompose it

            ## Code Quality
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns (especially for Fabric workload development)
            - TypeScript/React best practices for frontend changes
            - C#/.NET best practices for backend changes

            ## Fabric-Specific Checks
            - Proper use of Fabric SDK APIs
            - OneLake/Eventhouse integration patterns
            - Authentication and authorization handling
            - Tenant isolation considerations

            Be constructive and helpful. Smaller PRs = faster reviews = faster shipping.
